# to run the snakemake

conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake


snakemake --jobs <number_of_jobs> --cluster-config cluster.json --cluster "sbatch --cpus-per-task={cluster.cpus} --mem={cluster.mem} --partition={cluster.partition}" -p


Make sure to adjust <number_of_jobs> to the desired number of parallel jobs and provide a cluster.json file with the appropriate cluster configuration, such as the number of CPUs, memory, and partition.

Note that the Snakemake version includes three rules: all, remove_duplicates, and flye_assembly. The all rule specifies the final output files, the remove_duplicates rule removes duplicates, and the flye_assembly rule performs the flye assembly. The params.resume parameter is used to determine whether the --resume flag should be included based on the existence of the output folder.





Activate the desired Conda environment:


conda activate <environment_name>
Run Snakemake in verbose mode:


snakemake --snakefile Snakefile --verbose
Replace <environment_name> in step 2 with the name of the Conda environment you want to use for running Snakemake. The --verbose flag in step 3 enables verbose output, providing more detailed information about the execution of rules and commands.

Make sure you are in the directory where the Snakefile is located before running the Snakemake command.

Note: If you have renamed the Snakemake file to snake_make_map, replace --snakefile Snakefile in step 3 with --snakefile snake_make_map.



To run Snakemake on a computing cluster running Slurm, it's recommended to submit the Snakemake job as a Slurm job rather than running it directly in a shell script. This allows the cluster's job scheduler to manage resource allocation and job scheduling.

Here's an example of how you can submit a Snakemake job to Slurm:

Create a shell script, e.g., submit_snakemake.sh, with the following content:


#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J snakemake_job  # Job name
#SBATCH --partition=himem  # Partition/queue name
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16  # Number of CPUs per task
#SBATCH --mem=50GB  # Memory per node


# Activate the desired Conda environment
conda activate <environment_name>

# Change to the directory where the Snakefile is located
cd /path/to/your/snakefile/directory

# Run Snakemake with the specified Snakefile and desired options
snakemake --snakefile Snakefile --verbose --use-conda --cores $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
Replace <environment_name> with the name of the Conda environment you want to activate for running Snakemake.

Make the script executable:


chmod +x submit_snakemake.sh
Submit the script as a Slurm job:


sbatch submit_snakemake.sh
This will submit the Snakemake job to the Slurm job scheduler, and the scheduler will allocate the requested resources and execute the job.

Make sure to adjust the Slurm parameters (#SBATCH lines) in the script according to your cluster's configuration and resource requirements.

By submitting the Snakemake job as a Slurm job, you can take advantage of the cluster's scheduling capabilities and resource management.




To run this Snakemake workflow on a computing cluster running Slurm, you can submit it as a job using the sbatch command. Save the Snakemake code in a file named Snakefile. Then, create a shell script (e.g., run_snakemake.sh) with the following content:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J snakemake_job
#SBATCH --partition=your_partition
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
#SBATCH --mem=8G

module load Anaconda3
source activate snakemake_env

snakemake --snakefile Snakefile --verbose --cores 16

Make sure to replace your_partition with the appropriate partition on your computing cluster. You may also need to adjust the --cpus-per-task, --mem, and --cores options based on your specific requirements.

To run the workflow, submit the job to Slurm using the following command:

bash
Copy code
sbatch run_snakemake.sh
This will execute the Snakemake workflow using the specified Slurm job settings and activate the minimap conda environment.

Note: Before running the workflow, make sure you have set up the snakemake_env conda environment with Snakemake installed. You can create the environment and install Snakemake by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
conda create -n snakemake





Save the script as Snakefile.

Create a file named config.yaml with the following contents:

yaml
Copy code
resources:
  mem: 78GB
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved Snakefile.

Activate your conda environment.

Run the following command to execute the Snakemake workflow:

shell
Copy code
snakemake --snakefile Snakefile --cores 1 --use-conda --profile slurm
Make sure to adjust the --cores value according to the number of available cores on your machine. The --profile slurm option tells Snakemake to use the SLURM profile defined in the ~/.config/snakemake/slurm directory.

Snakemake will automatically download the genome files, concatenate them, and then perform the necessary steps for each fastq file. Once the workflow is complete, the output files will be generated.

Please note that you may need to adjust the paths and file names in the script and SLURM flags to match your specific setup.
